AI Operations Triage Agent (AOTA)

📌 AI-Driven Operations Triage
Turning Alert Chaos into Actionable Decisions
1️⃣ The Real Problem (30–40 sec)
What actually breaks in enterprises
•	Hundreds of alerts daily from multiple systems
•	Alerts are noisy, inconsistent, and repetitive
•	Triage depends on individuals, not systems
•	Critical issues get buried → delayed response
Impact:
•	SLA breaches
•	Customer impact
•	Compliance and audit gaps
•	On-call fatigue
This is not a tooling problem. It’s a decision-quality problem.

2️⃣ What We’re Solving (30 sec)
Objective
Create a decision layer between alerts and humans that:
•	Standardizes incoming alerts
•	Filters duplicates and noise
•	Assigns severity and ownership early
•	Calculates SLA timelines automatically
Key idea:
Automate the thinking humans repeat every day.

3️⃣ The Solution (60 sec)
AI-Assisted Triage Pipeline
When an alert comes in:
1.	Normalize the alert into a common structure
2.	Enrich context (environment, keywords, history)
3.	Use AI + rules to:
o	Classify severity
o	Suggest owner/team
o	Recommend next actions
4.	Compute SLA due time immediately
5.	Store everything in a single operational register
Outcome:
•	Faster response
•	Clear accountability
•	Predictable operations

4️⃣ What Leaders Actually Get (40 sec)
Business Value
•	Critical alerts surfaced early
•	Reduced false escalations
•	Clear audit trail
•	SLA visibility from minute zero
Operational Value
•	Less alert fatigue
•	Fewer handoffs
•	Consistent decisions across teams
This scales operations without scaling headcount.

5️⃣ Lightweight Technical View (Last 60–90 sec)
How it’s implemented (brief)
•	Event-driven workflow
•	AI used only where judgment is needed
•	Deterministic rules for repeatable logic
•	Outputs written to a structured register
•	Notifications triggered automatically
(At this point, show the n8n flow briefly and then the final Google Sheet with 3–4 dummy records)
“The tool is replaceable. The logic is the asset.”
