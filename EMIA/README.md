# 🧠 Enterprise Meeting Intelligence Agent (EMIA)

**Turning enterprise meetings into clear decisions, accountability, and risk visibility**

## What is EMIA?

**Enterprise Meeting Intelligence Agent (EMIA)** is a lightweight AI agent that converts unstructured meeting discussions into **clear, structured business intelligence.**

It ensures that **decisions, actions, owners, and risks discussed in meetings are not lost** —and are ready for leadership review.

This project demonstrates **practical, enterprise-safe use of AI agents,** not experimentation.

## The Problem It Solves

In most Enterprises:
* Critical decisions are discussed verbally but not formally captured
* Action items lack clear ownership or timelines
* Risks are mentioned casually and never tracked
* Follow-ups depend on memory or manual notes
* Leaders spend time re-clarifying what was already discussed
* Meetings produce value — but organizations fail to operationalize it.

## The Solution

EMIA listens to meeting transcripts and produces **decision-ready output:**
* Executive summary (what really matters)
* Decisions taken
* Action items with owners
* Risks or blockers identified
* Clear follow-ups

The output is **structured, auditable, and review-friendly** — suitable for leaders, risk teams, and operations.

## Why This Matters (Enterprise Lens)

This is **not a consumer meeting summarizer.**

EMIA is designed with:
* Accountability over convenience
* Clarity over verbosity
* Governance over novelty
It reflects how **AI should be applied responsibly in regulated, large organizations.**

## Why Now?
* Enterprises are encouraging AI adoption — but safely
* Manual meeting documentation does not scale
* Leadership expects better traceability
* Agentic AI is moving from theory to execution

This project demonstrates **how AI agents can be applied today, without risk.**

## High-Level Flow (Conceptual)

Meeting Transcript
→ AI Agent
→ Structured Intelligence

No black boxes. No auto-decisions. Human review always remains.

## Technology (High Level)
* n8n (workflow orchestration)
* Large Language Models (OpenAI)
* Google Sheets / Email (optional outputs)

Technology is intentionally **simple and explainable.**
